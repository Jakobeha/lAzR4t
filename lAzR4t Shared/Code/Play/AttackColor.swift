///The color of a projectile or turret.
///Each color makes the projectile act a different way,
///taking more damage or combining differently.
///- Red projectiles take the most damage
///- Blue projectiles have the most control: they the combined projectile's direction the most.
///- Green projectiles take the least damage and have the least control, except for grey, but when combined they significantly strengthen the strongest projectiles' effects
///- Grey projectiles aren't actually used, but they could, and they have the absolutely least stats
